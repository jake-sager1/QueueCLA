# QueueCLA

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The point of this project was to solve a problem rampant on UCLA's campus -- what the British call queuing.

UCLA students don't like to physically queue, so we began implementing a solution to virtually queue.
