# QueueCLA

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The point of this project was to solve a problem rampant on UCLA's campus -- what the British call queuing.

UCLA students don't like to physically queue, so we began implementing a solution to virtually queue.

## Installation & Set up

In the directory of your choice, run the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/jake-sager1/QueueCLA.git
    cd QueueCLA

Now, run the following command:

    npm install
    
This will install all the dependencies to the local node_modules folder.
